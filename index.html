            <h2>Grand Opening Statement</h2>
            <p>Summit Agility was born out of passion—not for titles or trends, but for people. For the founders who’ve already escaped the broken systems and are building something better. For the teams who want clarity, not chaos. For the ones who care more about getting it right than looking good.</p>
            <p>We’re not here to impress. We’re here to help. To show up when things get messy and make them clear again. To bring order without ego, and support without noise.</p>
